## Demystifying AI
`AI: ANI, AGI`<br>

ANI: **artificial narrow intelligence** e.g. amart speaker, self-driving car, web search, AI in farming and factories

AGI: **artificial generate intelligence** do anything a human can do

`Machine Learning: software`

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

`Data Science: slide deck`

Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data

`Internet company`

A/B testing<br>
short iteration time<br>
decision making pushed down to engineers and other specialized roles

`AI company`

strategy data acquisition<br>
unified data warehouse<br>
pervasive automation <br>
new roles (e.g. MLE) and division of labor

`AI Transformation`
* excute pilot projects to gain momentum
* build an in-house AI team 
* provide broad AI training
* develop an AI strategy
* develop internal and external communications


## Building AI Projects
`key steps of a machine learning project`
* Collect data
* Train model: iterate many times until good enough
* Deploy model: get data back, maintain/update model

`key steps of a data science project`
* Collect data
* Analyze data: iterate many times to get good insights
* Suggest hypothesis/actions: deploy changes, re-analyze new data periodically

`Brainstorming Framework`
* think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs. e.g., call center routing
* what are the main drivers of business
* what are the main pain points in your business

`You can make progress even without big data`
* having more data almost bever hurt
* data make some business (like web searching) defensible
* but with small datasets, you can still make progress

`Due diligence on project`

**Technical diligence** what AI can do
* can AI system meet desired perfoormance
* how much data is needed
* engineering timeline

**Business diligence** value for your business
* lower costs
* increase revenues
* launch new product or business

`Build vs. buy`
* ML projects can be in-house or outsource
* DS projects are more conmmonly in-house
* Some things will be industry standard - avoid building those

`Specify your acceptance criteria`
* Goal: detect defects with 95% accuracy
* Provide AI team a dataset on which to measure their performance
* Pitfall expecting 100% acc: Limit of ML, insufficient data, mislabeled data, ambiguous labels

`CPU vs. GPU`

CPU: computer processor (Central Process Unit)

GPU: graphics processing unit

`cloud deployment vs. On-premises deployment`


## Building AI in your company

### Case study: smart speaker
`Steps to process the command`
"Hey device, tell me a joke"
* _Trigger word/wakeword detection_: audio -> 'hey device' 0/1
* _Speech recognition_: audio -> 'tell me a joke'
* _Intent recognition_: 'tell me a joke' -> joke? time? music? call? weather?
* _Execute command_

### Case study: Self-drving car
`Steps for deciding how to drive`

Image/Radar/Lidar + GPS, Maps => (Car detection & Pedestrian derection => Trajectory prediction) & Lane detection & Traffic light detection & obstacle detection => Motion Planning => Steer/Accelerate/Brake
